\chapter{Lay Summary}

Computer graphics is the science of generating pictures on a computer screen. There is an inherent trade off between making the images look realistic and generating them fast. Current work has pushed both ends of the spectrum, images either look more realistic and take longer, or they are generated faster. Very little work has done in striking a balance between the two. 

This thesis implements a workload that takes a highly realistic effect, raytraced ambient occlusion, and analysis the feasibility of rendering it quickly. We explore the trade-offs between visual quality and speed of image generation for this particular workload. 
Based on the outcome from our analysis, we propose new changes to the state of the art computer architecture of compute cores to facilitate faster visual effects without changing the existing hardware.
