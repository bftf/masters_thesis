\chapter{Preface}
This  dissertation  is  based  on  a  research  project  conducted  by  myself  under  the supervision and guidance of Professor Tor M. Aamodt.  I assisted with defining the problem space and was responsible for deriving mathematical solutions, identifying  challenges  within  this  problem  space,  and  designing  and  optimizing  the algorithm to evaluate the proposed idea. I also conducted the experiments and collected all the data represented in this dissertation. Tor  M.  Aamodt  provided  valuable  guidance  and  directions  in  identifying the research problems, developing solution methodologies, and documenting the results.
